# PingPongGame
Hellooooo, 

It is a Computer vision project. 
Using our own hand we can control the movement of the ball which collides with a paddle and this traditional game has scoreboard and total missed cases.
if you want to run this code in your local machine you can use the files in source code and then set the trackbars according to your skin color.

and then Enjoyyyyy!!
